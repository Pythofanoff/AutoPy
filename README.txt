<DESCRIPTION>
 V. of library: 0.0.1

 AutoPySC is a easy lib for create tree of project. 

 This library was originally written for my own small, private projects, 
but I decided to keep it publicly available. 
Perhaps one day this small script will grow into something bigger.

<HOW TO LAUNCH?>
 1) In terminal: pip install AutoPySC
 
 or:

 Folder AutoPySC, transport along the path:  (.\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages) 
 
 2) In terminal: python -m AutoPySC-main


Creates the following structure:
