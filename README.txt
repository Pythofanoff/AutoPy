<DESCRIPTION>
 v. of lib: 0.0.1

 AutoPySC or Auto Python Structure Creator - is a easy lib for create tree of project. 

 This library was originally written for my own small, private projects, 
but I decided to keep it publicly available. 
Perhaps one day this small script will grow into something bigger.

<HOW TO LAUNCH?>
 1) In terminal: pip install APySC
 
 or:

 Folder APySC, transport along the path:  (.\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages) 
 
 2) In terminal: python -m APySC


Creates the following structure:

<MyProjects>
