AutoPy is a easy lib for create tree of project. 
v.0.0.1

Folder AutoPy, transport along the path:  (.\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages)
In terminal: python -m AutoPy

This library was originally written for my own small, private projects, 
but I decided to keep it publicly available. 
Perhaps one day this small script will grow into something bigger.
