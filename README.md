```﻿<DESCRIPTION>```
 v. of lib: 0.0.1

 AutoPySC or Auto Python Structure Creator - is a easy simple lib for create tree of project. 

 This library was originally written for my own small, private projects, 
but I decided to keep it publicly available. 
Perhaps one day this small script will grow into something bigger.

Creates the following structure:

```
MyProjects/
├── src/
│   ├── configs/
│   ├── logs/
│   ├── functions/
│   ├── classes/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── images/
│   └── caches/
├── VirtualEnviroment
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

<HOW TO LAUNCH?>
 1) In terminal: ```pip install APySC```
 
 or:

 Folder APySC, transport along the path:  ```.\python\python38-32\lib\site-packages```
 
 2) In terminal: ```python -m APySC```
